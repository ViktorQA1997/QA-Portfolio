**Description:** 

I tested the Petstore API service using Postman by creating a public API collection that included both happy path and negative test scenarios. The work involved sending POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests, verifying correct responses for successful operations, and simulating errors such as invalid data or repeated deletions. For each request, I added at least two automated tests using Postman snippets to validate status codes and response content, ensuring proper API key authorization. In addition, I created an advanced collection with 5â€“8 varied tests covering both successful and error scenarios, following an API testing checklist, and optionally explored SOAP requests in SoapUI using a provided WSDL.
